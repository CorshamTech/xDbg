;=====================================================
; Steps one instruction.  Note that this fails if the
; instruction is followed by data rather than another
; instruction, such as "jsr putsil" which is followed
; by ASCII text.  Sorry, no easy way to figure this
; out.  cmdOffset points to char after S.
;
; So there are three scenarios to figure out where to
; place the BRK instruction:
;
; (1) There is a JMP or JSR which transfers control
;     to another address.
; (2) There is a branch instruction.  This can be a
;     BRA, or a conditional.  The BRK's placement
;     depends on whether the branch will be taken or
;     not.
; (3) There is a BBSx or BBRx instruction.  Very 
;     much like the relative branches but a specific
;     but must be Set or Reset in a specific zero
;     page address to take the branch.  The nstruction
;     is three bytes long.
; (3) The easiest case, put the BRK at the next
;     instruction after the current one.
